This repository contains a list of vim modules I find particularly handy.  Through the power of git submodules, I only need to run update.sh to update all modules to their latest listing.

To load the content of the plugins, use the following:
`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`

Many thanks to the authors of the modules for the immense amount of time and effort that must have gone into making such wonderful products.

Have a wonderful time!
