This repository contains a list of vim modules I find particularly handy.  Through the power of git submodules, I only need to run update.sh to update all modules to their latest listing.

Many thanks to the authors of the modules for the immense amount of time and effort that must have gone into making such useful software.

Have a wonderful time!
