Note: I've decided to switch from [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) ). My list of Vim plugins can now be found within [my vimrc file](https://github.com/kfr2/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc).

This repository contains a list of vim modules I find particularly handy.  Through the power of git submodules, I only need to run update.sh to update all modules to their latest listing.

To load the content of the plugins, use the following:
`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`

Many thanks to the authors of the modules for the immense amount of time and effort that must have gone into making such useful software.
